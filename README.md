SecureCipher – Cryptographic Workflow Audit
Overview

SecureCipher is a middleware-driven secure transaction pipeline designed to ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity between a banking frontend client, a middleware gateway, and a banking API. This document presents a structured audit of the system’s payload flow, cryptographic operations, and verification steps.

The workflow is divided into three main stages:

Frontend → Middleware (encrypted transaction request)

Middleware → Banking API (verified transaction forwarding)

Banking API → Middleware → Client (final response)

1. Frontend → Middleware
Incoming Encrypted Payload
{
  "ciphertext": "...",
  "iv": "...",
  "ephemeral_pub_key": "..."
}

Decrypted Inner Payload
{
  "transaction_data": "...",
  "nonce": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "client_ECDSA_public_key": "..."
}

Middleware Processing

ECDHE Key Exchange

Middleware uses its static private key and the ephemeral_pub_key from the client.

Derives a shared symmetric key (via HKDF or similar).

Uses derived key + iv to decrypt the ciphertext.

Signature Verification

Validate the client’s signature against transaction_data using client_ECDSA_public_key.

If verification fails → respond with SIG_VERIFY_FAIL (encrypted response back to client).

If verification passes → continue.

Replay Protection

Validate nonce and timestamp to prevent replay attacks and nonce reuse.

Middleware Signature Generation

Generate middleware_signature over the payload.

Construct the verified payload for the Banking API:

{
  "transaction_data": "...",
  "client_signature": "...",
  "client_ECDSA_public_key": "...",
  "middleware_signature": "...",
  "middleware_ECDSA_public_key": "..."
}

2. Middleware → Banking API
Incoming Payload
{
  "transaction_data": "...",
  "client_signature": "...",
  "client_ECDSA_public_key": "...",
  "middleware_signature": "...",
  "middleware_ECDSA_public_key": "..."
}

Banking API Processing

Client Signature Verification

Verify client_signature against transaction_data using client_ECDSA_public_key.

Middleware Signature Verification

Verify middleware_signature against the payload using middleware_ECDSA_public_key.

Failure Case

If either signature verification fails:

Respond with appropriate error code (CLIENT_SIG_FAIL, MIDDLEWARE_SIG_FAIL, etc.).

Transaction is not processed.

Success Case

If both signatures are valid:

Transaction is marked authentic and untampered.

transaction_data is processed according to business logic (e.g., transfer, register, withdraw).

Final response is generated.

3. Banking API → Middleware → Client
Banking API Response

Construct success or error response based on transaction processing.

Send back to Middleware.

Middleware Response Handling

Encrypt the response payload using a new ephemeral key + ECDHE with client’s public key.

Construct secure response:

{
  "ciphertext": "...",
  "iv": "...",
  "ephemeral_pub_key": "..."
}


Send encrypted response to client.

Client Decryption

Client performs ECDHE with ephemeral key from Middleware.

Derives symmetric key and decrypts response.

Displays result to user.

Security Guarantees

Confidentiality: All payloads are encrypted using ephemeral ECDHE keys.

Authenticity: Dual-signature model enforces trust of both client and middleware.

Integrity: Payload tampering is prevented via signature checks.

Replay Protection: Nonce + timestamp verification ensures requests are unique.

End-to-End Trust: Transactions only succeed when both client and middleware are validated by the Banking API.
